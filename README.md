IPL Victory Probability Estimator üèèüîÆ
Project Overview
Welcome to the IPL Victory Probability Estimator! This project aims to predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using historical match data and machine learning. As a cricket enthusiast or analyst, you can leverage this tool to gain data-driven insights and enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the game.

The core of this project involves developing a robust predictive model, analyzing extensive IPL match data, and deploying an interactive web application to make predictions easily accessible to users.

‚ú® Features
Data-Driven Predictions: Forecasts match outcomes based on a comprehensive analysis of historical IPL data.
Intuitive Web Application: An interactive user interface built with Streamlit allows users to input match details and receive real-time victory probabilities.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a supervised learning model (mention specific model if decided, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on key match parameters.
Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Robust handling of raw data from Kaggle, including cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation.
Model Persistence: The trained machine learning model is saved using pickle for efficient loading and deployment.
